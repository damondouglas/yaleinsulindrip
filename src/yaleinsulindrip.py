The following IIP is intended for use in hyperglycemic adult patients in the ICU, adapted from our earlier protocols, in keeping with the latest glucose guidelines from national organizations. It should
NOT be used in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), as these patients may require higher initial insulin doses, IV dextrose at some point, and important
adjunctive therapies for their fluid/acid-base/electrolyte/divalent status. (See 'DKA Guidelines' in YNHH Clinical Practice Manual (CPM) for further instructions.) In any patient with BG >500 mg/dL,
the initial orders should also be carefully reviewed with the MD, since a higher initial insulin dose and additional monitoring/therapy may be required. If the patientâ€™s response to the insulin infusion is
at any time unusual or unexpected, or if any situation arises that is not adequately addressed by this protocol, the MD must be contacted for assessment and further orders.

PATIENT SELECTION: Begin IIP in any ICU patient with more than 2 BGs >180 mg/dl who is not expected to rapidly normalize their
glycemic status. Patients who are eating (see #9 below); transferring out of ICU imminently (<24 hrs); or pre-terminal or being considered
for CMO status are generally not appropriate candidates for this IIP.

TARGET BLOOD GLUCOSE (BG) RANGE: .120-160 mg/dL

INSULIN INFUSION SOLUTION: Obtain from pharmacy (1 unit Regular Human Insulin / 1 cc 0.9 % NaCl).
PRIMING: Before connecting, flush 20 cc infusion through all tubing.
